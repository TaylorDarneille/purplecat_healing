		<h1>BodyWork</h1>
		<p>The pillars of the Bodywork sessions are mindfulness and movement; an intentional and heart based approach to listening. Breath and a cultivation of trust.  Session are informed by form and anatomy yet driven by a deeper source born through breath, stillness and movement, and contact with the body in space. We cannot separate our bodies from our trauma but we can use the body as a doorway into relationship with trauma that allows for evolution and burgeons the possibility of living with more depth and clarity; less bound to that which we may not have chosen but ushers us towards embodied liberation and offers a deeper relationship to our bodies and to life; we can become agents for change both personally and collectively. Bodywork sessions include deep tissue work, joint manipulation, passive stretching, structural adjustments, jostling and energy work to move and settle the system. </p>

		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>
			You are <span>here</span>. Please take a moment to <span>feel</span> into yourself. Where is your breath right <span>now</span>?
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to let go and move into our current calling of body . mind . heart .  spirit -
		</p>
		<p>
			We must first let in that which our patterning has us trying to escape and forget.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>The inherent and intelligent presence of the body. Here. Now.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to let in, we must first connect.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to connect, we must first take time to feel.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to feel we must be resourced.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am here to be in service to that resourcing with in  the body of your personal story and experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe that the body and interconnected energetic intelligence has much to teach us; to help up heal, remember, renew and connect.   I believe that our wounds and shadows hold some of our most potent life force.  Through cultivated awareness, listening and a redirecting of patterning have more access to Self and the omnipotent intelligence we are part of is possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			To bring our inner systems up to date and into current time is a deep and spacious process requiring intention, care and support.  I am here to support what is needing to move and what is needing to ground in order let your past and future selves and cells arrive to present time.
